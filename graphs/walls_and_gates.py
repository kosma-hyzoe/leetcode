https://neetcode.io/problems/islands-and-treasure

You are given a mÃ—n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values:

    -1 - A water cell that can not be traversed. 0 - A treasure chest. INF - A
    land cell that can be traversed. We use the integer 2^31 - 1 = 2147483647
    to represent INF.

Fill each land cell with the distance to its nearest treasure chest. If a land
cell cannot reach a treasure chest than the value should remain INF.

Assume the grid can only be traversed up, down, left, or right.
